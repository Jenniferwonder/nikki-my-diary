# Description

Nikki - My Diary is an online journal where users can pen down their
thoughts and feelings to improve their Japanese Skills. Nikki (jap. 日記 (Kanji)、
にっき (Hiragana) means diary, and it is still common on Japan to use a diary to
write down their daily lifes. Besides studying Japanese Grammar or vocabulary
with books, it is highly recommended to write a diary in Japanese language to
improve their Japanese skills.

Therefore, Nikki - My Diary is being created. It makes it easy for students to
write down their feelings from everywhere, setting reminders to keep progress
and motivates the user by sending quotes.
