‼️ In progress. I am updating my progress on the app every day.

❗This is a project created for the Auth0 x Hashnode Hackathon in August 2021.
Description

Nikki - My Diary will be an online journal where users can pen down their thoughts and feelings to improve their Japanese Skills. Nikki (jap. 日記 (Kanji)、にっき (Hiragana) means diary, and it is still common on Japan to use a diary to write down their daily lifes. Besides studying Japanese Grammar or vocabulary with books, it is highly recommended to write a diary in Japanese language to improve their Japanese skills.

Therefore, Nikki - My Diary is being created. It makes it easy for students to write down their feelings from everywhere, setting reminders to keep progress and motivates the user by sending quotes.
Project Setup

The app contains 3 views:

    Home view - with description about the app and motivation quotes
    Profile view - where the user can add their diary entries
    Calendar view - where the user can set reminders

Techstack: ReactJS, Auth0, TailwindCSS.
Current progress

All views have their basic setup. The home view contains a hello message, the profile view lets the user add entries and view them in a grid, and the calendar view contains a calendar with the current date.

I am currently working on three branches (home, profile, calendar).
Home branch

I am currently designing the app with Figma. The home view needs much styling, therefore, it will not be updated soon.
Profile view

I am currently working on a modal to add entries instead of an textarea field in the component itself. Also, until now, all entries are stored in localStorage. I want to connect the app to a database. The view of the each entrie should also look differently, I am still working on a design for it.
Calendar view

The calendar is present. I am working on an entrie api to show the entries on each date. Also, it should be possible to create reminders which will be shown on the left side of the component under the date heading.
