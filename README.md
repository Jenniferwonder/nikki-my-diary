:bangbang: In progress. I am updating my progress here after every finished step.

:exclamation:This is a project created for the Auth0 x Hashnode Hackathon in
August 2021.

# Description

Nikki - My Diary will be an online journal where users can pen down their
thoughts and feelings to improve their Japanese Skills. Nikki (jap. 日記 (Kanji)、
にっき (Hiragana) means diary, and it is still common on Japan to use a diary to
write down their daily lifes. Besides studying Japanese Grammar or vocabulary
with books, it is highly recommended to write a diary in Japanese language to
improve their Japanese skills.

Therefore, Nikki - My Diary is being created. It makes it easy for students to
write down their feelings from everywhere, setting reminders to keep progress
and motivates the user by sending quotes.

# Project Setup

The app contains 3 views:

- Home view - with description about the app and motivation quotes
- Profile view - where the user can add their diary entries
- Calendar view - where the user can set reminders

Techstack: ReactJS, Auth0, TailwindCSS.

# Current progress

All views have their functionalities and basic styles. The home view contains a
hello message, the profile view lets the user add entries via modal and view
them in a grid, and the calendar view contains a calendar with the current date,
where you can add reminders.

## Home branch

I am currently designing the app with Figma. The home view needs much styling,
therefore, it will not be updated soon.

## Profile view

Everything works as expected. Styling needs to be done.

## Calendar view

I am working on the functionality to show the entries on a specific date.
